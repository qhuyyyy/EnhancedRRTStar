\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Motion planning is a central problem in robotics and autonomous systems, requiring the computation of collision‑free trajectories from an initial configuration to a goal configuration in potentially complex and cluttered environments \cite{1, 2}. The problem's computational complexity grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the configuration space, making efficient algorithms crucial for practical applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to robotic manipulation systems \cite{3, 4, 5}. Sampling-based methods have gained extensive adoption in both research and industry as they handle complex environments and guarantee probabilistic completeness \cite{6}. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm \cite{7} pioneered this approach, offering efficient exploration of large state spaces through randomized tree construction. However, RRT's inherent suboptimality motivated the development of RRT* \cite{8}, which guarantees asymptotic optimality through systematic rewiring operations while maintaining the exploration efficiency of its predecessor. Despite its theoretical advantages, RRT* suffers from several practical limitations. First, its uniform random sampling strategy often results in poor exploration in obstacle-dense environments—many samples fall inside obstacles, slowing convergence and yielding suboptimal performance \cite{8, 9}. Second, the use of a fixed rewiring radius does not adapt to local node density, leading to inefficient tree structures and further slowing convergence \cite{10, 11}. These weaknesses are particularly problematic in time-critical applications such as autonomous navigation, UAV flight planning, and robotic manipulation, where planning efficiency directly impacts performance and safety \cite{12, 13}.

(c) Informed RRT* exhibits focused exploration within an ellipsoidal sampling region, leading to more concentrated tree growth. (d) Enhanced RRT* showcases adaptive sampling, dynamic rewiring, and goal-directed exploration, achieving the most compact tree and optimal path. The comparison highlights how Enhanced RRT* overcomes the limitations of previous approaches through intelligent sampling and rewiring strategies.} 
\label{fig:algorithm_comparison} 
\end{figure} 

Recent advances in sampling-based planning have introduced various improvements to address these challenges. Informed RRT* \cite{14} restricts sampling to admissible regions defined by the current best solution, significantly improving convergence speed. Batch Informed Trees (BIT*) \cite{15} combines sampling with graph search techniques, while RRT*-Smart \cite{16} introduces path optimization through multiple rewiring iterations. However, these approaches often trade computational efficiency for solution quality or require extensive parameter tuning, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, our proposed Enhanced RRT* is the improved variant of the sampling based path planning algorithms that addresses the fundamental limitations of existing approaches through the following novel contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Sampling:} A multi-resolution sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts sampling density based on local obstacle distribution, significantly reducing the number of invalid samples while maintaining exploration completeness. A novel adaptive sampling framework that reduces invalid sample generation by 67.3\% compared to uniform sampling while maintaining exploration efficiency.

    \item \textbf{Intelligent Dynamic Rewiring:} A radius optimization mechanism that adapts the rewiring neighborhood based on local node density, improving tree structure quality and convergence speed. An intelligent rewiring mechanism that improves path quality by 12.4\% while reducing computational overhead by 41.2\% compared to standard RRT*.

    \item \textbf{Goal-Directed Exploration with Adaptive Bias:} An exploration strategy that intelligently balances goal-directed sampling with random exploration, accelerating convergence while preserving probabilistic completeness.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec2} reviews related work. Section~\ref{sec3} details the proposed methodology, including adaptive sampling, dynamic rewiring, and goal‑directed exploration. Section~\ref{sec4} presents the experimental setup, comparative results, and analysis. Section~\ref{sec5} concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec2}

Sampling-based motion planning has evolved significantly since the introduction of RRT \cite{7}, with numerous algorithms addressing various aspects of the planning problem \cite{17, 18}. This section provides a comprehensive review of relevant work, focusing on improvements to RRT* and related approaches. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm \cite{7} established the foundation for sampling-based motion planning, introducing the concept of randomized tree construction for efficient exploration of high-dimensional spaces. RRT's key innovation lies in its bias toward unexplored regions through Voronoi bias, enabling rapid exploration of large configuration spaces \cite{19}. However, RRT's lack of optimality guarantees motivated the development of asymptotically optimal variants. RRT* \cite{8} represents a significant advancement by introducing rewiring operations that guarantee asymptotic optimality while maintaining the exploration efficiency of RRT. The algorithm's theoretical properties have been extensively analyzed \cite{8}, establishing its probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality under mild assumptions on the sampling distribution. Recent work has focused on improving sampling efficiency through various strategies. Informed RRT* \cite{14} restricts sampling to an ellipsoidal region containing all configurations with cost lower than the current best solution, dramatically improving convergence speed. This approach has been extended to handle multiple objectives \cite{17} and dynamic environments \cite{18, 20}. Alternative sampling strategies include goal-biased sampling \cite{21}, which increases the probability of sampling near the goal configuration, and obstacle-aware sampling \cite{22}, which adapts sampling density based on local obstacle distribution. These approaches demonstrate improved performance in specific scenarios but often require careful parameter tuning. The rewiring mechanism in RRT* has been the subject of numerous improvements. RRT*-Smart \cite{16} introduces multiple rewiring iterations to optimize path quality, while Fast RRT* \cite{22} reduces computational overhead through efficient neighbor search algorithms. Other approaches focus on dynamic radius adjustment \cite{23} and tree pruning strategies \cite{24} to improve efficiency. Furthermore, several recent approaches employ learning-based sampling strategies, in which machine learning techniques are integrated with sampling-based motion planners to guide the exploration toward promising regions of the configuration space \cite{25, 26}. One of the learning-based sampling strategies \cite{27} uses neural networks to predict promising sampling regions, while other hybrid approaches combine sampling-based methods with optimization techniques \cite{28}. These methods show promise but often require extensive training data and may lack theoretical guarantees.
 Apart from this, the recent, RE-RRT* algorithm \cite{29} introduces a novel approach by constraining the sample space during tree growth and adapting sampling along the displacement from initial to goal point. This method reduces redundant searches and achieves faster convergence with shorter paths. However, it may struggle in highly cluttered environments where the displacement-based sampling strategy becomes less effective. The BRRT*-DWA approach \cite{30} combines bidirectional RRT* with dynamic window approach for mobile robot navigation, providing real-time obstacle avoidance capabilities. While effective for mobile robots, this hybrid approach introduces additional complexity and may not be suitable for all planning scenarios. Although existing approaches address specific aspects of the path planning problems, they often suffer from one or more of the following limitations including: (1) increased computational complexity for improved solution, (2) reliance on extensive parameter tuning, (3) lack of adaptability to different environment characteristics, (4) theoretical guarantees that may not translate to practical performance, or (5) limited applicability to specific robot types or environments.

The proposed Enhanced RRT* addresses these limitations through a unified framework that jointly optimizes sampling efficiency, tree structure quality, and computational overhead while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical applicability across diverse environments and robot configurations.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec3}

This section presents the Enhanced RRT* algorithm, beginning with a high-level architecture and problem formulation, followed by detailed descriptions of the three key contributions.

\subsection{Algorithm Architecture}\label{subsec1}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{diagram.png}
\caption{High-level architecture of Enhanced RRT*. The algorithm integrates three key innovations: (1) Adaptive Goal Bias modulates sampling probability towards the goal, (2) Adaptive Sampling generates intelligent samples prioritizing obstacle-free regions, and (3) Dynamic Rewiring optimizes tree connectivity using adaptive radius.}
\label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

The flowchart illustrates an enhanced RRT* algorithm that incorporates three key contributions, including adaptive goal bias, adaptive sampling, and dynamic rewiring, into the conventional RRT* framework to enhance performance in challenging environments. The algorithm initiates by establishing initial configurations including start and goal positions, environmental mapping data, and algorithmic parameters. The Adaptive Goal Bias mechanism continuously modifies sampling probabilities directed toward the goal configuration, ensuring optimal balance between exploration of the configuration space and exploitation of promising regions. Concurrently, the adaptive sampling strategy generates candidate sampling points by analyzing local obstacle distributions, thereby prioritizing obstacle-free regions for more efficient exploration. Upon identifying a candidate point, the algorithm locates the nearest existing node in the tree structure and applies steering logic: if the Euclidean distance exceeds the predefined step size $s_{\mathrm{step}}$, the algorithm advances precisely $s_{\mathrm{step}}$ units toward the sample; otherwise, it attempts a direct connection. Following this, a comprehensive collision detection process evaluates path feasibility, discarding blocked samples and incorporating collision-free candidates as new tree nodes. The algorithm then performs neighbor discovery within an adaptive radius $r_{\mathrm{adapt}}$ that dynamically adjusts based on tree growth characteristics, subsequently selecting optimal parent nodes through cost minimization while ensuring collision-free connectivity. The Dynamic Rewiring mechanism then optimizes tree structure by reassigning connections to minimize overall path costs and enhance solution quality. This comprehensive process iterates continuously until predefined termination conditions are satisfied, such as successful goal achievement or reaching the maximum iteration limit $N_{\mathrm{iter}}^{\max}$. The enhanced approach demonstrates significant improvements over standard RRT* implementations, achieving faster convergence rates, generating more optimal and smoother trajectory solutions, and providing enhanced robustness when operating in complex, obstacle-rich, or dynamically changing environments, thereby establishing superior effectiveness for practical robotic navigation applications. 

\subsection{Problem Formulation}\label{subsec2}

Following the standard formulation in motion planning literature \cite{4}, we consider a configuration space $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with obstacle region $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{obs}} \subset \mathcal{C}$ and free space $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}} = \mathcal{C} \setminus \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{obs}}$, where $d$ denotes the dimensionality of the configuration space. 

Given a start configuration $q_{\mathrm{start}} \in \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}}$ and a goal configuration $q_{\mathrm{goal}} \in \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}}$, the optimal path planning problem seeks a collision-free path $\sigma: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}}$ that minimizes the cost functional:

\begin{equation}
    J(\sigma) = \int_0^1 c(\sigma(t), \sigma'(t)) \, dt
\end{equation}

subject to $\sigma(0) = q_{\mathrm{start}}$, $\sigma(1) = q_{\mathrm{goal}}$, and $\sigma(t) \in \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}}$ for all $t \in [0,1]$, where $c: \mathcal{C} \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is a cost function (e.g., path length or energy consumption) and $\sigma'(t)$ represents the derivative of the path with respect to time.

The optimal path planning problem can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \sigma^* = \arg\min_{\sigma \in \Sigma} J(\sigma)
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma$ is the set of all feasible paths from $q_{\mathrm{start}}$ to $q_{\mathrm{goal}}$, and $\sigma^*$ represents the optimal solution.

\subsection{Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Sampling}\label{subsec3}

The adaptive sampling strategy adjust sampling density according to local obstacle distribution, inspired by density-based sampling \cite{31} and adaptive techniques \cite{3}.

For a given configuration $q \in \mathcal{C}$, the local obstacle density $\rho(q)$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \rho(q) = \frac{1}{\lvert \mathcal{N}_\rho(q) \rvert}
    \sum_{q' \in \mathcal{N}_\rho(q)} \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{obs}}}(q').
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}_\rho(q)$ is the set of points within a fixed radius $r_\rho$ of $q$ (neighborhood for density computation), and $\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{obs}}}$ is the obstacle indicator function that returns 1 for obstacle configurations and 0 otherwise.

The neighbor radius for rewiring is
\begin{equation}
   r_{\mathrm{neighbor}}(q,n)
    = \min\!\Big\{\, r_{\max},\;
    \max\!\big[\, r_{\min}(n),\; \alpha_s\, r_{\min}(n)\, g(\widehat{c}(q)) \big] \Big\},
    \quad g(c)=1+\beta_s c.
\end{equation}
with:
\[
    r_{\min}(n) = \gamma_r \left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)^{\!\frac{1}{d}}
\]
where $\gamma_r$ satisfies the asymptotic optimality condition \cite{8}, $\widehat{c}(q) \in [0,1]$ is the normalized local complexity measure, $\alpha_s$ is a sampling adaptation scaling factor, $\beta_s$ is the sampling bias parameter, and $n$ represents the current number of nodes in the tree.

The adaptive sampling probability is:
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{\mathrm{adapt}}(x) =
    \frac{(1-\rho(x))^{\beta_s}}
    {\displaystyle \int_{\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}}} (1-\rho(u))^{\beta_s}\,du},
    \qquad x\in \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{free}}.
\end{equation}
where $\beta_s > 1$ biases sampling toward obstacle-free areas, and the denominator ensures proper normalization of the probability distribution.

Temporal adaptation:
\begin{equation}
    p_{\mathrm{adapt}}^{(t+1)}(q) = \lambda \, p_{\mathrm{adapt}}^{(t)}(q) + (1-\lambda) \, p_{\mathrm{success}}^{(t)}(q)
\end{equation}
where $p_{\mathrm{success}}^{(t)}(q)$ is the success ratio of extending from $q$ within a sliding window, and $\lambda \in [0,1]$ is the learning rate that controls the balance between historical and current success rates.

\subsection{Intelligent Dynamic Rewiring}\label{subsec4}

The adaptive rewiring radius for a new node $q_{\mathrm{new}}$ is:
\begin{equation}
    r_{\mathrm{adapt}}(q_{\mathrm{new}}, n) =
    \min\!\Big\{ r_{\max},\;
    \max\!\big[\, r_{\min}(n),\; \alpha_r\, \overline{d}(q_{\mathrm{new}})\, Q(q_{\mathrm{new}}) \big] \Big\}.
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    r_{\min}(n) = \gamma_r \left( \frac{\log n}{n} \right)^{\!1/D}.
\end{equation}
$\overline{d}(q_{\mathrm{new}})$ is the mean neighbor distance within $r_{\max}$, and $Q(q)$ is the quality function:
\begin{equation}
    Q(q) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\big(-\gamma_q \, (\delta(q) - \tau)\big)}
\end{equation}
with $\delta(q)$ representing the normalized local density, $\tau$ denoting the density threshold, and $\gamma_q$ being the sensitivity parameter that controls the steepness of the quality function.

Rewiring set:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{rewire}}(q_{\mathrm{new}})
    = \big\{ q \in \mathcal{V}\; \big|\; \|q-q_{\mathrm{new}}\|\le r_{\mathrm{adapt}}(q_{\mathrm{new}},n)\ \wedge\ B(q,q_{\mathrm{new}})>0 \big\}.
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{V}$ represents the set of all tree vertices, and the rewiring benefit function $B(q, q_{\mathrm{new}})$ is:
\begin{equation}
    B(q, q_{\mathrm{new}}) =
w_1\,\Delta^{\mathrm{norm}}_{J}(q, q_{\mathrm{new}})
+ w_2\,T^{\mathrm{norm}}(q, q_{\mathrm{new}}).
\end{equation}
Here, $w_1$ and $w_2$ are weighting factors for cost improvement and tree quality respectively, $\Delta^{\mathrm{norm}}_{J}$ represents the normalized cost improvement, and $T^{\mathrm{norm}}$ denotes the normalized tree quality measure.

\subsection{Goal-Directed Exploration with Adaptive Bias}\label{subsec5}

The adaptive goal bias is:
\begin{equation}
    p_{\mathrm{goal}}(q_{\mathrm{nearest}})
    = p_{\mathrm{base}} \exp\!\big(-\beta_g\,\mathrm{dist}(q_{\mathrm{nearest}},q_{\mathrm{goal}})\big)
    + p_{\min}.
\end{equation}
with $p_{\mathrm{base}}$ being the base probability for goal-directed sampling, $\beta_g$ controlling the decay rate, and $p_{\min}$ ensuring a non-zero minimum bias for goal exploration.

Sampling rule:
\begin{equation}
    q_{\mathrm{sample}} =
\begin{cases}
q_{\mathrm{goal}}, & \text{with probability } p_{\mathrm{goal}}\!\big(q_{\mathrm{nearest}}\big),\\
q_{\mathrm{cand}}, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $q_{\mathrm{cand}}$ represents a random candidate configuration generated during the exploration phase.

The mathematical framework presented above provides a rigorous foundation for the Enhanced RRT* algorithm. The symbol definitions ensure clarity and reproducibility, while the parameter table offers practical guidance for implementation and tuning. Each parameter has been carefully calibrated through extensive empirical evaluation to achieve optimal performance across diverse environment configurations.

\section{Experiments}\label{sec4}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}\label{subsec1}

Following the evaluation methodology established in \cite{8}, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on three distinct environment configurations designed to test different aspects of algorithm performance:

{
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
 \textbf{Easy Environment (15×10):} Simple configuration with sparse obstacles (obstacle density: 12.3\%), designed to test basic algorithm functionality and establish baseline performance metrics. The environment features wide corridors and minimal geometric complexity.
    
\textbf{Medium Environment (25×20):} Moderate complexity with structured obstacles (obstacle density: 28.7\%), testing algorithm scalability and performance in moderately challenging scenarios. The environment includes narrow passages and structured obstacle patterns.
    
\textbf{Hard Environment (35×30):} Complex maze-like configuration with dense obstacles (obstacle density: 45.2\%), representing the most challenging scenario for path planning algorithms. The environment features narrow corridors, dead ends, and complex geometric structures.}

Each environment is characterized by different obstacle densities and geometric complexity, providing a comprehensive test of algorithm robustness and performance across varying difficulty levels.

The algorithm parameters have been systematically optimized through extensive empirical evaluation and cross-validation. Table~\ref{tab:comprehensive_parameters} presents the comprehensive parameter values that achieve the best trade-off between exploration efficiency and solution quality:

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Performance Metrics and Comparison Algorithms}\label{subsec2}

Following the rigorous evaluation standards established in \cite{8} and \cite{14}, we employ a comprehensive set of performance metrics to systematically assess algorithm performance across multiple dimensions:

{
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
 \textbf{Path Length:} Total Euclidean distance of the planned path, measured in configuration space units. For a path $\sigma = [q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n]$, the path length is calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
        L(\sigma) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|q_i - q_{i-1}\|_2
        \label{eq:path_length}
    \end{equation}
    where $\|q_i - q_{i-1}\|_2$ is the Euclidean distance between consecutive waypoints $q_i$ and $q_{i-1}$.
    
\textbf{Computation Time:} Total time required to find a solution, measured in seconds using high-precision timing with microsecond resolution. The computation time $T_{plan}$ is measured from algorithm initialization to path completion.
    
\textbf{Tree Size:} Number of nodes in the final tree after planning completion, indicating memory usage and exploration efficiency. The tree size $N_{tree}$ represents the total number of vertices in the RRT structure, including all sampled and connected nodes.
    
\textbf{Path Accuracy:} Ratio of optimal path length to actual path length, providing a normalized measure of solution quality. The path accuracy is defined as:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Path Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Optimal Path Length}}{\text{Actual Path Length}}
        \label{eq:path_accuracy}
    \end{equation}
    where optimal path length is computed using A* algorithm on a fine grid approximation of the environment, and actual path length is obtained from the RRT* solution. Higher accuracy values (closer to 1.0) indicate better path quality.
    
\textbf{Success Rate:} Percentage of successful path planning attempts across multiple trials. For each environment configuration, we conduct $N_{trials} = 20$ independent planning attempts and calculate:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Plans}}{N_{trials}} \times 100\%
        \label{eq:success_rate}
    \end{equation}
    where a planning attempt is considered successful if a collision-free path from start to goal is found within the maximum iteration limit.
}

We compare Enhanced RRT* against three well-established algorithms, all algorithms are implemented with identical collision checking and distance computation functions to ensure fair comparison:

{
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\textbf{RRT:} The original Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm \cite{7}, serving as a baseline for comparison.
    
\textbf{RRT*:} The asymptotically optimal variant \cite{8}, representing the current state-of-the-art in optimal sampling-based planning.
    
\textbf{Informed RRT*:} The informed sampling variant \cite{14}, which restricts sampling to admissible regions for improved convergence.}


Additionally, we provide qualitative comparisons with recent state-of-the-art approaches including RE-RRT* \cite{29} and BRRT*-DWA \cite{30} to contextualize our contributions within the broader research landscape.

Figure~\ref{fig:detailed_comparison} shows that Enhanced RRT* demonstrates superior performance across all three environment configurations, with particularly notable improvements in complex scenarios. In the Easy environment (15×10), Enhanced RRT* achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1\%, representing a 5.9\% improvement over Informed RRT* and a 19.8\% improvement over basic RRT, while maintaining competitive computation time (0.032 seconds) and efficient tree size (58 vertices). The Medium environment (25×20) results highlight Enhanced RRT*'s scalability advantages, where it achieves the fastest computation time (0.044 seconds) among all algorithms while maintaining excellent path accuracy (87.5\%) and generating only 55 vertices compared to 66 for Informed RRT*. The most compelling evidence of Enhanced RRT*'s superiority emerges in the Hard environment (35×30), where the algorithm achieves exceptional accuracy of 98.8\% (3.1\% improvement over Informed RRT*), fastest computation time (0.049 seconds), and most compact tree structure (68 vertices, representing a 19.0\% reduction compared to Informed RRT*). This comprehensive performance improvement across all metrics validates the effectiveness of our adaptive sampling and dynamic rewiring mechanisms, particularly in complex, obstacle-dense environments where traditional algorithms struggle with exploration efficiency.

Figure~\ref{fig:corridor} present the path corridor heatmap analysis, which aggregates path distributions from multiple planning runs to identify frequently traversed regions and algorithm exploration patterns. This analysis reveals that Enhanced RRT* concentrates its exploration more efficiently within optimal corridors, reducing unnecessary exploration of peripheral regions while maintaining solution quality. The heatmap demonstrates how our adaptive sampling strategy focuses computational effort on promising areas of the configuration space.

Figure~\ref{fig:f2} present the tree growth evolution analysis, capturing the progressive development of search trees at different completion stages (25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%). This visualization demonstrates how Enhanced RRT* achieves more goal-directed exploration compared to other algorithms. While RRT and RRT* show scattered, wide-ranging exploration patterns, Informed RRT* and Enhanced RRT* exhibit increasingly focused exploration within optimal regions. Enhanced RRT* particularly stands out by maintaining exploration efficiency while rapidly converging toward the goal, resulting in more compact tree structures and faster solution discovery.

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our three key algorithmic innovations. The adaptive obstacle-aware sampling strategy demonstrates significant improvements over uniform sampling, with analysis showing a 67.3\% reduction in invalid sample generation while maintaining exploration completeness. This improvement is particularly pronounced in complex environments where obstacle density varies significantly. Compared to RE-RRT*'s \cite{29} displacement-based sampling approach, our adaptive sampling provides more environment-specific optimization by considering local obstacle distribution rather than just geometric displacement.

The intelligent rewiring mechanism shows consistent improvement in path quality across all test environments. The adaptive radius adjustment results in 12.4\% better path quality compared to fixed-radius rewiring while reducing computational overhead by 41.2\%. This approach differs from BRRT*-DWA's \cite{30} hybrid strategy by focusing on pure sampling-based optimization rather than combining with reactive navigation methods.

The adaptive goal bias strategy accelerates convergence while maintaining solution quality. Analysis indicates faster convergence to initial solutions compared to standard RRT*, with maintained asymptotic optimality guarantees. This approach provides a more principled alternative to the heuristic-based strategies employed in recent variants.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}\label{sec5}

This study introduces \textit{Enhanced RRT*}, an advanced variant of the RRT* algorithm designed to overcome the practical and theoretical limitations of classical sampling-based motion planners. By integrating adaptive obstacle-aware sampling, dynamic rewiring, and goal-biased exploration, the proposed method achieves a compelling balance between path optimality, computational efficiency, and robustness in complex planning environments.

Our empirical evaluations across diverse map configurations demonstrate that Enhanced RRT* consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, it achieves up to 90.8\% planning accuracy, reduces invalid sample generation by 67.3\%, and improves path quality by 12.4\%. In addition, the algorithm maintains compact tree structures, leading to reduced memory consumption and faster convergence, characteristics that are essential for real-time robotic applications.

Beyond empirical gains, Enhanced RRT* contributes to the theoretical understanding of efficient sampling-based planning. The proposed adaptive sampling strategy provides new insights into environment-aware sample distribution, while the dynamic rewiring mechanism underscores the value of adaptive neighborhood selection in tree-based exploration. Additionally, the integration of goal-directed bias enhances global convergence without compromising exploration diversity.

The practical relevance of Enhanced RRT* is evident in its applicability to domains such as autonomous ground navigation, UAV path planning, robotic arm manipulation, and embedded real-time systems. Its ability to maintain high performance with limited computational resources positions it as a strong candidate for deployment in resource-constrained or time-critical scenarios.

Nonetheless, several challenges remain. The algorithm exhibits sensitivity to parameter tuning, which may affect generalization across varied domains. Furthermore, the current implementation assumes static environments and does not account for dynamic obstacle interaction. Future research directions include: (i) the development of self-adaptive parameter selection based on environmental feedback; (ii) extension to dynamic and partially observable environments with real-time replanning capabilities; (iii) scaling to high-dimensional or multi-agent systems; and (iv) deployment and benchmarking on physical robotic platforms to validate real-world performance.

In conclusion, Enhanced RRT* advances the state-of-the-art in sampling-based motion planning by offering a principled and effective framework that is both theoretically grounded and practically viable. Its contributions lay a solid foundation for future research in adaptive planning and intelligent robot autonomy.
